Again i started with a google search with some of the text from the description. "name of 11 zero-day vulnerabilities"

Looking through the search results on google and reading some of the articles, people are not really referenceing the 11 vulnerabuilites as 1 specific name.\
Until i found this link:-

**Urgent/11** stood out to me on this webpage

So i tried the flag: ***syskronCTF{URGENT/11}***
